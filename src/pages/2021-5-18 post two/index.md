How's your son? (All, all, all the things, things) 

He make the team this year? (All, all, all the things things)

Aw th-, they said he wasn't tall enough?

(All, all, all that glitters is not gold)

Yeah, me we gon' cook this up (All gold is not reality)

Sunday okay? Just come by

That's your new girlfriend?

This is family business

And this is for the family that can't be with us

And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us

That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet

Like a photo of your granny's picture

Now that you're gone it hit us

Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right

Yeah, you heard the track I did man, "This Can't Be Life"

Somebody please say grace so I can save face

And have a reason to cover my face

I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it

Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it

When I brought it why did the guard have to look all to it?

As kids we used to laugh

Who knew that life would move this fast?

Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?

And look, you tell me you ain't did it, then you ain't did it

And if you did, then that's family business

And I don't care 'bout (All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)

They don't mean a thing (All, all, all the things)

All these fancy things

I tell you that all my weight in gold (Now gold is not reality)

Now all I know, I know, all these things

This is family business

And this is for everybody standin' with us

Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture

Abi, remember when they ain't believe in me?
